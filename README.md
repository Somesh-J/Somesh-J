## 🎓 My Learning Journey

```
C Programming → Web Fundamentals → Cybersecurity & CTFs → Python Mastery → Cloud & Production Systems
```

**What started as curiosity became a career:**

1. **Foundation (Year 1):** Started with C programming, explored how browsers and servers communicate, built static websites
2. **Security Exploration (Year 2):** Dove into CTF challenges, learned penetration testing with Kali Linux, mastered tools like Nmap and Burp Suite
3. **Python Mastery (Years 3-4):** Realized Python's versatility across web dev, security, and AI/ML. Built production projects combining all interests
4. **Production Reality (Present):** Working at a startup taught me what "production-ready" really means—scalability, monitoring, CI/CD, and real user impact

> *"Self-learning taught me how to research effectively, debug problems independently, and stay resilient. Every error became a lesson. Every failed deployment pushed me to improve."*
